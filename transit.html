    <h1>Hack: Take Public Transit</h1>
    <div id="mainparagraph">
        <p>We have a pretty good public transit system here in Victoria. If you are a youth (18 and under), you can get a monthly pass for just $45 or $540/year. For adults (19+) it's $85/month or $1020/year. On average car insurance is $1832/year in Canada, not to mention the cost of gas and maintenance. By taking public transit you not only save money, but you also save the environment.</p>

        <h1>BC Transit's Sustainabiliy</h1>
        <p>In November 2018, BC transit approved a Low Carbon Fleet Program. This was to help them support provincial GHG emissions targets, and align with the CleanBC plan. Then, in 2020 as a part of this program, BC transit replaced 95 diesel buses with much quieter, greener CNG (compressed natural gas) buses. These can be seen around Victoria, where 'CNG' is displayed near the top of the bus. The use of CNG reduces CO2 emissions and lowers operational costs. BC transit is also continually reducing its impact on the environment through new technologies. The bus wash at the Kamloops Transit Center recycles 80% of the water it uses. From 2021-2025 BC transit plans to acquire more than 130 electric buses, these include electric heavy duty buses, electric double decker buses, and electric light duty buses. Between 2025-2031 BC transit would like to acquire more than 800 additional electric buses, these will be used to replace the fossil fuel models.</p>
