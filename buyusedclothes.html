    <h1>Hack: Buy Used Clothing</h1>
    <div id="mainparagraph">
        <p>Fast fashion allows consumers to buy inexpensive and stylish clothing, but it has some serious environmental and ethical impacts. Buying used clothing helps you avoid this and also saves you money. </p><img id="mainimg" src="images/fastfashion.webp" alt="Image of a clothes rack overflowing with clothing">
        <h1>Recycling Textiles</h1>
        <p>Almost anyone would agree that we are more likely to throw away cheap and trendy clothing, over more costly ones. The Environmental Protection Agency says that in 2018 there was <em>17 million tons of textile waste</em>, and only <em>2.5 million tons were recycled</em>. Other materials like paper, glass, and plastic often get recycled at a higher rate than clothing does. This is because clothing uses short-fiber fabrics, which are cheaper and thinner, but cannot be rewoven into new fabrics. Also, blended fabrics are now so common (ex. a 100% cotton t-shirt has other materials in the labels and sewing materials like polyester). It is extremely tough to separate all these materials for recycling, and even if we could do it, it would require hours of skilled labor (expensive). It is estimated that <em>$500 billion is lost anually</em> from the clothing that is barely worn or not recycled.</p>
        <h1>CO2 From Fast Fashion</h1>
        <p>Not only does fast fashion leave millions of tons of waste in the landfill, but it impacts the environment through carbon dioxide emissions. Every year, 10% of our global CO2 emissions come from the fashion industry, which is more than all the international flights and maritime shipping combined. If things don't change by 2050, researchers project that the fashion industry will account for a quarter of our CO2 emissions. Most of the carbon emissions come from the transportation of these clothes (factory --> retail outlet --> consumer). Also, many textiles are derived from petrochemicals, which releases a lot of CO2 during extraction and production.</p>
        <h1>Water Pollution From Fast Fashion</h1>
        <p><img id="mainimg" src="images/ffwaterpollution.jpeg" alt="Water pollution from fast fashion">Clothing that is made of synthetic materials often contain microplastics. Washing these clothes, or even having them sit in the landfill (where they are subject to rain) causes the microplastics to run into water systems, and eventually into the ocean. A study published in Environmental Science and Technology found that on average more than 1,900 fibers can come off of synthetic clothing during a single wash. The dyes and chemicals used to color and set the fabrics are very toxic to the workers as well as the environment. Factories will often put wastewater into nearby rivers, which pollutes agricultural and drinking water supplies for people and animals.</p>
        <h1>What can you do to help?</h1>
        <p>When you are shopping, try to think about quality over quantity (then we avoid buying fast fashion items all together). Even better, don't buy new clothing, and by used clothes instead. This saves a piece of clothes from the landfill, and doesn't require any new resources (but it also saves you money). Many thrift stores are also charities, and shopping there is a great way to support your community. Also, repair your clothing, rather than throwing them away. If you cannot do it on your own, find a tailor or seamstress who can help.</p>
        <p>Another thing you can do is upcycle your clothing, find ideas for that <a href="upcycleclothing.html" id="upcyclelink">here</a></p>
