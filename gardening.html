    <h1>Hack: Composting at Home</h1>
    <div id="mainparagraph">
        <p>Worm composting, also known as <em>vermicomposting</em> or <em>vermiculture</em>, is a great way to reuse your old food scraps. It only requires about 30 minutes of maintenance per week, and produces natural, odor-free compost. The most time consuming task is harvesting the fertilizer every three to six months. This can be used to feed your home garden, without the use of fertilizer or store bought compost. A homemade worm composter costs about thirty dollars, while a fancy one from the store can be one-hundred fifty dollars. Even the more costly option can pay itself off within one season, especially if you are using it to replace organic, store bought compost.<br></p><img id="mainimg" src="images/wormcompost.jpeg" alt="Worm Composter Diagram">
        <h1>Making your own Indoor Worm Composter</h1>
        <p>A worm composter is basically just a box with holes for ventilation and moisture. These are normally made with a plastic bin with a lid, and raised off the ground to allow for water to drain from the bottom. All you have to do is drill holes (a few inches apart) in the sides and bottom of your bin. The holes in the bottom allow for water drainage, and the holes in the sides allow for air flow. You can glue small containers to the bottom of the bin to raise it up (eg. cream cheese containers).<br>After creating your composter, you will need to add some bedding for the worms. Good bedding for indoor composters include shredded paper, shredded cardboard, and egg cartons. Place this bedding in the bottom of the composter, and add a big scoop of garden soil on top. Pour in some water, you want the soil to be not too wet, but not too dry.<br>Now you need to purchase some worms. The red wiggler worm is the best species for this, as it is extremely efficient at breaking down organic material. A pound of worms (about one-thousand worms) will eat exactly half their body weight everyday, be sure to weight your food waste so you know exactly how many worms to buy. Getting the right amount of worms is extremely important, and will keep your bin from getting infested by insects and pests.<br>Worms can eat <em>almost any fruit and vegetable waste</em>. <em>Do not give them any meat, dairy, fats, or bones</em>. They also <em>struggle with the outer skin of onions, and do not like too much citrus</em>. You <em>can give them coffee grounds, filters, napkins, shredded paper towels, and non plastic teabags</em>. To add this waste to the bin, just dig a hole in the top and place the scraps inside. Also, check to see if there is anything they have not eaten, and remove it.</p>
